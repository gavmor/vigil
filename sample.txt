Just got a call from Mr. Smith of Smith Industries. He's bringing along two additional guests. We need to adjust the seating arrangement and meal count. 🍽
The AV company just informed me that one of the microphones is malfunctioning. I'm trying to find a replacement ASAP. 🎤
We're running low on company-branded pens for the gift bags. Can someone pick up some more from the office? 🖊
The event planner is stuck in traffic. She might be late. I'll coordinate with the venue staff in the meantime. 🚗
The caterer's invoice is higher than expected. I'm looking into it now. 💸
One of our volunteers called in sick. We need someone else to help guide guests to their seats. 🤒
I've just been informed of a last-minute change to our company's strategy that I need to incorporate into my speech. I'll need some quiet time to revise it accordingly. 📝
📨☎ Just sent out the final reminders and confirmed the attendance. We have a full house tonight! 🏠
🎶 AV equipment is all set up. I've tested everything and it's all working perfectly.
🎊 Promotional materials and gift bags are ready. They look great!
I just got off the phone with the event planner. Everything is on track. 👍
💰 All bills are paid and we're still under budget! 
We have a team of 15 volunteers ready to help out tonight. They'll be wearing name tags so they're easy to spot.
Can you grab some extra napkins? We might need more than we originally thought.
And maybe some extra batteries for the microphones, just in case.
